# Bootstrap-Framework-Account-Website
An accounting website redesign for a local company. Using the Bootstrap 4 grid framework for responsive design. 

Custom navbars created for mobile devices. A few extra written media queries to remove the parallax header on mobile devices and make other small cosmetic changes. 

PHP mail service for the contact form, redirect after submission. Needs some JQuery validation rules.
